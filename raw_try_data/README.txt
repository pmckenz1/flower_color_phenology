    * I think this is all public data as well -- although not certain. I think it's a subset of the public data. Some authors of private data did not give permissions so I went through and looked, and they (and a bunch of the other data sources) were for African flora, so I excluded those sources. It looks like my resulting table is much smaller! Maybe best not to use this one.
