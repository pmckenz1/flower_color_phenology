# Final datasets

## 1_FULL_gpt_labeled_taxon.csv
The results from the GPT4 mapping of categorical color to plant species.

## 2_fulldata_cleaned_matched_GPT_colors.csv
The full dataset of iNaturalist observations matched against GPT colors.
**Note: this dataset is too large to store on github but can easily be regenerated by running the following notebooks consecutively:**  
1) `flower_color_phenology/manuscript/data_notebooks/1_merging_raw_iNat_exports.ipynb`  
2) `flower_color_phenology/manuscript/data_notebooks/3_merge_GPT_taxon_colors_with_observations.ipynb`  

While running the first notebook, make sure to point the object `raw_obs_directory` to the folder containing the iNat exports: `flower_color_phenology/raw_inaturalist_exports/`  
While running the second notebook, make sure to:  
1) Point the object `coldf` to: flower_color_phenology/manuscript/final_data/1_FULL_gpt_labeled_taxon.csv  
2) Point the object `inatdata` to wherever notebook 1 output the combined csv. As written it will have the filename: `combined_raw_inaturalist_export.csv'`

## 3_validated_FULL_gpt_labeled_REDS_ONLY.csv
The manually validated subset of red-flowered taxa.

## 4_TRY_cleaned_colordata.csv
The full cleaned color data from TRY mapped to species.

## 5_cleaned_matched_colors.csv
The intersection of the TRY data with the species in the iNat dataset, inclusive of potential multiple color categories for an individual species.
